# VSCode Extension - [auto-run-command](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gabrielgrinberg.auto-run-command#review-details)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GabiGrin/vscode-auto-run-command.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GabiGrin/vscode-auto-run-command)

Run a command when VSCode starts, based on some conditions.
Built to run [Wallaby.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.wallaby-vscode) automatically on projects that have a config.
I decided to make it a bit more generic to play around with the API (and because developing an extension there is super smooth! Awesome work VSCode guys!)

## Usage
The way this extension works is by reading a list of rules from your settings.
Each rule is evaluated and if the rule's condition is met, a command is ran.

A rule consists of a condition, a command and an optional message. The message will be shown if the condition is met.

You need to open your settings: File -> Preferences -> User Settings, and add a rule. Check below for examples.

ProTipâ„¢: Both `command` and `condition` accept arrays. If you pass in multiple conditions, all of them have to be met. If multiple commands are passed, all of them will run.

Note: commands run after a 5s delay to ensure the command was registered. If there's a better way to do that other than delaying, let me know!

## Example Settings

1. Simple -Running wallaby.js when vscode opens on a folder with a config file
```javascript
"auto-run-command.rules": [
		{
			"condition": "hasFile: wallaby.js",
			"command": "wallaby.start",
			"message": "Running wallaby"
		}
	]
```

2. Running some command (assuming an extension exposed it) when vscode opens on a specific project containing a specific file
```javascript
"auto-run-command.rules": [
		{
			"condition": [
				"hasFile: special-file",
				"isRootFolder: my-coolz-prodgekt"
			]
			"command": "crazy-ext.do-magic",
			"message": "Super condition met. Running "
		}
	]
```

## If you find a real usage for this other than wallaby.js I'll be glad to know! Leave a message in the issues part.
